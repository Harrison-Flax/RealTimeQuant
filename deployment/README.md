Will be using Kubernetes with Docker to build container images and run them separately. This will be used for testing and fragmenting the program into frontend, backend, and database containers so we can manage each of the parts separately and efficiently.



Kubernetes and Docker are both industry standard tools which is our motivation for learning and using them here to make this feel like a more professional program.
