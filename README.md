This is our project, RealTimeQuant, for CS3377 (Ethical Issues in Computing). 

We have successfully integrated:
- FAST API between backend, frontend, and external APIs
- Integration with FRED and ChatGPT APIs
- Reading in, processing, and formatting data from csv files
- Login page
- Dummy two-factor authentication
- Using charts to get inferences from data

Note: 
- Node.Js is used to manage the server along Vite and Uvicorn to handle running both the frontend and backend in one command and terminal
- We used React, Python, CSS, and Node.Js in development
